            <ol>
                <li><b>OnePub Pty Ltd</b>, trading as <b>Ivanhoe Handyman Service (IHS)</b>, shall perform the services
                    <b>discussed</b> or
                    provided by way of a <b>Quote</b> (the <b>'Services'</b>).
                </li>
                <li>You shall provide <b>IHS</b> with all necessary information and access required in order to
                    perform the
                    Services.</li>
                <li>All prices are inclusive of GST unless otherwise stated.</li>
                <li>Payment in full must be made on the day.</li>
                <li>If you fail to make payment, interest (calculated daily from the due date until the date payment is
                    made in full) shall accrue and be payable on the overdue amount at the rate of 1.5% per
                    calendar month.</li>
                <li>Any quote is valid for 30 days from the date of issue.</li>
                <li>Any unforeseen work or materials required to complete the Services may be charged for in addition to
                    any amounts set out in the Quote, following consultation with you.</li>
                <li>In the event that <b>IHS</b> supplies any goods or materials in relation to the Services
                    ('Goods'), <b>IHS</b>
                    retains ownership of such Goods until payment for the goods is made in full, and all risk in the
                    Goods shall pass to you on delivery (or deemed delivery).</li>
                <li>Where <b>IHS</b> has designed Goods or a type of Service for you, then the copyright in those designs
                    shall
                    remain vested in <b>IHS</b>, unless otherwise agreed by <b>IHS</b>.</li>
                <li><b>IHS</b> will take all reasonable care when providing the Services. Except to the extent required
                    by law,
                    <b>IHS</b>
                    will not be liable to you for any loss, damage or expense you may suffer or incur in connection with
                    the
                    provision of Services, and in any case, the liability of <b>IHS</b> will be limited to the actual
                    direct
                    damages suffered by you and will under no circumstances exceed the price of the services actually
                    paid
                    by you for the job during which the damage occurred. <b>IHS</b> shall not be liable for any indirect,
                    consequential, or special loss, or loss of profit, however arising, whether under contract or
                    otherwise.
                </li>

                <!-- New clauses start here -->
                <li><b>No responsibility for property damage:</b> All care will be taken during the performance of work;
                    however, <b>IHS</b> accepts no responsibility for accidental damage to property such as furniture,
                    fittings, vehicles, or landscaping. ("All care, no responsibility.")</li>

                <li><b>Clear access required:</b> Clear ingress and egress of at least <b>2 metres</b> must be available
                    at all times for safe access and movement of tools and materials. Please ensure vehicles or other
                    obstructions are not blocking access prior to the scheduled visit.</li>

                <li><b>Work area preparation:</b> Work areas must be cleared by the customer prior to arrival unless
                    otherwise agreed. This includes removal of furniture, appliances, and personal belongings from the
                    immediate work zone to allow safe and efficient completion of the job.</li>
                <!-- New clauses end here -->

                <li><b>IHS</b> shall not be liable in any way to you or be deemed to be in breach of these Terms and
                    Conditions if
                    it fails to supply the Services as a result of anything outside of its reasonable control.</li>

                <li>Where you are not a 'Consumer' (as that term is defined in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993) or
                    where
                    you are acquiring goods or services for the purpose of a business then:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>(i) The provisions of the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 shall not apply;</li>
                    <li>(ii) The only warranties, guarantees or undertakings we give you in relation to the goods and/or
                        services (whether in relation to quality, fitness for purpose or otherwise) are those which we
                        expressly stipulate to you in writing. However, where you are a Consumer, and are not purchasing
                        goods or services for the purpose of a business, then notwithstanding anything contained in these
                        terms and conditions you shall have all of the rights conferred on Consumers by the Consumer
                        Guarantees Act.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>A failure by <b>IHS</b> to exercise any right under these terms and conditions is not a waiver of, or
                    variation to, that right.</li>
                <li>If any provision of these terms and conditions shall be invalid, void, illegal or unenforceable, the
                    validity, existence, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected,
                    prejudiced or impaired.</li>
                <li>These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia and are subject to
                    the
                    jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria, Australia.</li>
                <li><b>IHS</b> reserves the right to review these terms and conditions at any time. If, following any
                    such
                    review, there is to be any change, that change will take effect from the date on which <b>IHS</b>
                    provides notice
                    of the same. If you do not agree with the changes, then you may stop using the Services.</li>
