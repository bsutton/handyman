                    <b>Discussed</b> or
                    provided by way of a <b>Quote</b> (the <b>'Services'</b>).
                </li>
                <li>You shall provide (<b>IHS</b>) with all necessary information and access required in order to
                    perform the

                <li>Payment in full, must be made on the day. </li>
                <li>If you fail to make the payment, interest (calculated daily from the due date until the date that
                    payment is made in full) shall accrue and be payable on the overdue amount at the rate of 1.5% per
                    calendar month.</li>
                <li>Any quote is valid for 30 days from the date of issue.</li>
                <li>Any unforeseen work or materials required to complete the Services may be charged for in addition to
                    any amounts set out in the Quote, following consultation with you.</li>
                <li>In the event that the <b>IHS</b> supplies any goods or materials in relation to the Services
                    ('Goods'), the <b>IHS</b>
                    retains ownership of such Goods until payment of the goods are made in full and all risk in the
                    Goods shall pass to you on delivery (or deemed delivery).</li>
                <li>Where <b>IHS</b> has designed Goods or type of Services for you, then the copyright in those designs
                    shall
                    remain vested in <b>IHS</b>, unless otherwise agreed by <b>IHS</b>.</li>
                <li><b>IHS</b> will take all reasonable care when providing the Services. Except to the extent required
                    by law,
                    <b>IHS</b>
                    will not be liable to you for any loss, damage or expense you may suffer or incur in connection with
                    the
                    provision of Services, and in any case, the liability of <b>IHS</b> will be limited to the actual
                    direct
                    damages suffered by you and will under no circumstances exceed the price of the services actually
                    paid
                    by you to <b>IHS</b>. <b>IHS</b> shall not be liable for your indirect, consequential or special
                    loss, or loss of
                    profit, however arising, whether under contract, or otherwise.
                </li>
                <li><b>IHS</b> shall not be liable in any way to you or be deemed to be in breach of these Terms and
                    Conditions if
                    it
                    fails to supply the Services as a result of anything outside of their reasonable control.</li>
                <li>Where you are not a 'Consumer' (as that term is defined in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993) or
                    where
                    you are acquiring goods or services for the purpose of a business then:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> (i)The provisions of the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 shall not apply;</li>
                    <li> (ii)The only warranties, guarantees or undertakings we give you in relation to the goods and /
                        or
                        services (whether in relation to quality, fitness for purpose or otherwise) are those which we
                        expressly stipulate to you in writing.
                        However, where you are a Consumer, and are not purchasing goods or services for the purpose of a
                        business, then notwithstanding anything contained in these terms and conditions you shall have
                        all
                        of the rights conferred on Consumers by the Consumer Guarantees Act.</li>
                </ol>
                <li> A failure by <b>IHS</b> to exercise any right under these terms and conditions, is not a waiver of,
                    or
                    variation to, that right.</li>
                <li> If any provision of these terms and conditions shall be invalid, void, illegal or unenforceable the
                    validity, existence, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected
                    prejudiced or impaired.</li>
                <li>These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia and are subject to
                    the
                    jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria, Australia.</li>
                <li><b>IHS</b> reserves the right to review these terms and conditions at any time. If, following any
                    such
                    review,
                    there is to be any change, that change will take effect from the date on which <b>IHS</b> provides
                    notice
                    of the same. If you do not agree with the changes, then you may stop using the Services.</li>
